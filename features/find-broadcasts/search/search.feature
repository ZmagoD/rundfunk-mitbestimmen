Feature: Search on find broadcasts page
  As a user
  I want to search the list of broadcasts by title
  To find my favourite shows

  Background:
    Given I am logged in

  Scenario: Search by title
    Given I have 10 broadcasts in my database
    And one broadcast with title "Search for: keyword"
    And I visit the find broadcasts page
    And I see 6 broadcasts to choose from
    When I search for "keyword"
    Then there is exactly one search result
    And the only displayed broadcast has the title:
    """
    Search for: keyword
    """

  Scenario: Sort by title
    Given I have one broadcast with title "Mickey Mouse Film"
    And one broadcast with title "Popeye Film"
    And one broadcast with title "Tom und Jerry Film"
    And one broadcast with title "I am different"
    And I visit the find broadcasts page
    When I search for "Film"
    And I click on alphabetical_order_descending
    Then there are exactly 3 search results
    And the results are ordered like this:
      | Title               |
      | Tom und Jerry Film  |
      | Popeye Film         |
      | Mickey Mouse Film   |
